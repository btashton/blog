    <p>One of the projects that I am working on is some improvements to
the Nuttx network stack, especially adding a primitive netfilter like
implementation. To do this I wanted to grab a development board with
two Ethernet interfaces out of the box. The SAMA5D3 Xplained board seemed
like a good start at a price point of $79, you can check out the features
<a href="http://www.atmel.com/tools/ATSAMA5D3-XPLD.aspx">here</a>.</p>
<p>There is also board support for this in Nuttx, so I won't have to worry
about the initial board bring up (which is really not too bad in Nuttx,
especially for ARM boards).</p>
<p>With the board you get a single micro-usb cable which is all you need
to get the board to boot into Linux.  I know that this board also has
a few stages of bootloaders which I want to see debug information from
so I also added and FTDI 3v3 UART cable which happens to plug nicely into
the UARD header (J23).  You can find one of these cables
<a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9717">here</a>.</p>
<p>The board is powered over the micro-usb interface at J6.  My setup looks like
this (insert photo). Now, just fire up miniterm on the USB-to-UART and you
will see something like this:</p>

<p>At this point you have a bash shell to have Linux fun in.</p>
<p>Let's take a quick look at what happened here so we can understand what
is needed to run Nuttx on this board.  There are actually 4 steps that the
board does through.
1. It looks to see if a bootloader called AT91Bootstrap is located in Flash.
In this case if did find it.
2. AT91Bootstrap is then run. This bootloader takes care of low level hardware
initialization, including: clocking, PIO, DRAM, NAND flash, serial flash,
serial EEPROM, SD Card, etc.  The source for this bootloader is located
<a href="https://github.com/linux4sam/at91bootstrap">here</a> and is actually fairly easy
to read if you have worked with other ARM SoC. By default this is compiled
so that it will run the uboot bootloader from DataFlash, but other
configuration examples exist and are documented in the README file.
3. U-boot loads. This is the most common embedded bootloader for loading Linux
anymore, and depending on what support has been compiled in can be quite
powerful. If we stop the boot process here and examine the U-Boot shell options
you can see they have enabled a large amount of the U-Boot features.</p>

<p>Since this includes all the U-Boot features I see a need for, I will not
be going into how to rebuild U-Boot, but if you want the source that Atmel is
using is located <a href="https://github.com/linux4sam/u-boot-at91">here</a>. This
looks to be close upstream, which is a good thing.  In the past I worked
with a Samsung SoC (the one used in the early iPhones) and it was a real
pain to use since they had made large changes to the memory controller code
both in the Linux Kernel and in U-Boot.  Don't use Samsung SoCs if you can
avoid it, or are a large enough customer that you will get all the docs
that are under NDA.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at what U-Boot is doing by default:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>U-Boot&gt; env print
baudrate=115200
bootargs=console=ttyS0,115200 earlyprintk mtdparts=atmel_nand:256k(bootstrap)ro,512k(uboot)ro,256K(env),256k(s
bootcmd=nand read 0x21000000 0x180000 0x80000;nand read 0x22000000 0x200000 0x600000;bootz 0x22000000 - 0x2100
bootdelay=3
ethact=gmac0
stderr=serial
stdin=serial
stdout=serial

Environment size: 427/131067 bytes
</pre></div>


<p>The two lines of interest really are <code>bootargs</code> and <code>bootcmd</code>.  Bootargs is
passed off to what ever kernel is loaded. Bootcmd is a list of all the U-Boot
commands that you want it to call, its very much like a bash script.  First
lets look at the <code>nand</code> commands that are being issued. U-Boot has reasonable
help system.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>U-Boot&gt; ? nand
nand - NAND sub-system

Usage:
nand info - show available NAND devices
nand device [dev] - show or set current device
nand read - addr off|partition size
nand write - addr off|partition size
    read/write &#39;size&#39; bytes starting at offset &#39;off&#39;
    to/from memory address &#39;addr&#39;, skipping bad blocks.
nand read.raw - addr off|partition [count]
nand write.raw - addr off|partition [count]
    Use read.raw/write.raw to avoid ECC and access the flash as-is.
nand write.trimffs - addr off|partition size
    write &#39;size&#39; bytes starting at offset &#39;off&#39; from memory address
    &#39;addr&#39;, skipping bad blocks and dropping any pages at the end
    of eraseblocks that contain only 0xFF
nand erase[.spread] [clean] off size - erase &#39;size&#39; bytes from offset &#39;off&#39;
    With &#39;.spread&#39;, erase enough for given file size, otherwise,
    &#39;size&#39; includes skipped bad blocks.
nand erase.part [clean] partition - erase entire mtd partition&#39;
nand erase.chip [clean] - erase entire chip&#39;
nand bad - show bad blocks
nand dump[.oob] off - dump page
nand scrub [-y] off size | scrub.part partition | scrub.chip
    really clean NAND erasing bad blocks (UNSAFE)
nand markbad off [...] - mark bad block(s) at offset (UNSAFE)
nand biterr off - make a bit error at offset (UNSAFE)
</pre></div>


<p>Looking at this we can see that the <code>nand</code> command is really just for memory
operations on the NAND hardware.  In order to perform the boot, U-Boot is
loading the kernel image and the kernel device tree into SDRAM/DDRAM before
issuing the boot command.  The bootz command is used for loading kernel zimage
files and takes the optional parameter of address of the device tree.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>bootz [addr [initrd[:size]] [fdt]]
    - boot Linux zImage stored in memory
        The argument &#39;initrd&#39; is optional and specifies the address
        of the initrd in memory. The optional argument &#39;:size&#39; allows
        specifying the size of RAW initrd.
        When booting a Linux kernel which requires a flat device-tree
        a third argument is required which is the address of the
        device-tree blob. To boot that kernel without an initrd image,
        use a &#39;-&#39; for the second argument. If you do not pass a third
        a bd_info struct will be passed instead
</pre></div>


<p>If you want to understand a bit more about device trees and how they work,
check out <a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/petazzoni-device-tree-dummies.pdf">this</a>.</p>
<p>Device trees have made things way better in the Linux Kernel for embedded
systems, and if you are doing a kernel build for an embedded board I highly
recommend learning about it.  Hopefully that gives a quick run down of how
the boot process works, and will set the stage for later posts.</p>
