software. So I expect that this blog will drag me into many different topics. And
perhaps encourage me to focus on a few of them a little more. I plan on using
this blog a notes and thought dump, and I hope that it will be of use to
others trying to muddle through problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few projects that I think are really cool:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://ombitron.com"&gt;Ombitron&lt;/a&gt;  -- I work as the CTO of this very cool
company and I love it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://fedoraproject.org"&gt;Fedora Linux&lt;/a&gt; -- I have been a very long time
user and former contributor.  It might not be the distro for everyone, but
as a developer I think it's great, and I have gotten to understand most of its
oddities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://nuttx.org"&gt;Fedora Linux&lt;/a&gt; -- This is an absolutely awesome RTOS for small
embedded systems and takes on the look of a POSIX system.  Gregory Nutt has
done an amazing job with this, and I enjoy working with it and contributing to
it. You should expect to see many articles on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://python.org"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; -- This is my go to language for the last years.
I use it for everything from little scripts to make my life easier, to big
data processing engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://ipython.org"&gt;iPython&lt;/a&gt; -- I use the notebook feature to write reports
where the data actually is part of the report and people can see how I came up
with the numbers.  I think this is really important if you want the reports to
be realivent going forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://flask.pocoo.org"&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt; -- This web microframework is awesome, and
I have used it in many projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SciPy and NumPy also rock for doing analysis. They have replaced MATLAB
for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://influxdb.com"&gt;InfluxDB&lt;/a&gt; -- I am really excited about this database
and the guys who write it seem to rock.  This is really the first project that
I have had to mess with Golang.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://docker.com"&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://coreos.com"&gt;CoreOS&lt;/a&gt; -- I have really
started to play with these services for doing microservice deployments, and
I really like it. I am sure these will come up as well.&lt;/li&gt;
