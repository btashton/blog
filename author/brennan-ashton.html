            <article>
                <p>I tinker in many things in the world of engineering, especially in hardware and
software. So I expect that this blog will drag me into many different topics. And
perhaps encourage me to focus on a few of them a little more. I plan on using
this blog a notes and thought dump, and I hope that it will be of use to
others trying to muddle through problems.</p>
<p>Here are a few projects that I think are really cool:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ombitron.com">Ombitron</a>  -- I work as the CTO of this very cool
company and I love it.</li>
<li><a href="http://fedoraproject.org">Fedora Linux</a> -- I have been a very long time
user and former contributor.  It might not be the distro for everyone, but
as a developer I think it's great, and I have gotten to understand most of its
oddities.</li>
<li><a href="http://nuttx.org">Fedora Linux</a> -- This is an absolutely awesome RTOS for small
embedded systems and takes on the look of a POSIX system.  Gregory Nutt has
done an amazing job with this, and I enjoy working with it and contributing to
it. You should expect to see many articles on it.</li>
<li><a href="http://python.org">Python</a> -- This is my go to language for the last years.
I use it for everything from little scripts to make my life easier, to big
data processing engines.</li>
<li><a href="http://ipython.org">iPython</a> -- I use the notebook feature to write reports
where the data actually is part of the report and people can see how I came up
with the numbers.  I think this is really important if you want the reports to
be realivent going forward.</li>
<li><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a> -- This web microframework is awesome, and
I have used it in many projects.</li>
<li>SciPy and NumPy also rock for doing analysis. They have replaced MATLAB
for me.</li>
<li><a href="http://influxdb.com">InfluxDB</a> -- I am really excited about this database
and the guys who write it seem to rock.  This is really the first project that
I have had to mess with Golang.</li>
<li><a href="http://docker.com">Docker</a> <a href="http://coreos.com">CoreOS</a> -- I have really
started to play with these services for doing microservice deployments, and
I really like it. I am sure these will come up as well.</li>
